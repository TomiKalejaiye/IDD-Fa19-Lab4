## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

The brown wire corresponds to ground, the red wire corresponds to the voltage supply, and the orange wire is the signal line for servo control, which when using Arduino goes to a pin on the arduino.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

The signal line should be on pin 9 for the Sweep sketch.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

In the Sweep code, the variable "pos" controls the angle, and the increment size in the for loop that increments "pos" controls the speed.

## Part C. Integrating input and output
